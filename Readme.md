Industrial Safety is essential for promoting worker safety, preventing accidents, ensuring compliance, and enhancing overall operational efficiency in industrial environments. This project aims to develop a real-time video analytics tool that enhances industrial safety by detecting and preventing potential hazards and unsafe situations in industrial environments.

## Model statistics
### 1. Class labels:
    [Hardhat, Mask, NO-Hardhat, NO-Mask, NO-Safety Vest, Person, Safety Cone,
    Safety Vest, machinery, vehicle]
The model that was used in order to train this model was the **yolov8l** model that consists of 268 layers and 43,668,288 parameters. The model needs approximately 165 GFLOPS of compute power to run.
The model was trained on a custom dataset with the aforementioned classes and the hardware that was required to train that model was: **2x Nvidia Tesla T4 GPUs with 16gb VRAM each, 30GB of RAM and 4v CPU compute Engine.**

The model was trained for **310 epochs** and took a total amount of time of nearly **36 hrs** to train completely.
### 2. Model Metrics:
#### a. mAP50 (B): 
The mAP50 B is the Mean Absolute Precision where it measures the Average Precision of detections that have at least a 50% overlap with ground truth objects while excluding those overlapping with the background.

#### b. mAP_0.5: 
The mAP_0.5 is the same as the previous one but in contrast, mAP_0.5 calculates Average Precision based on detections with an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5 or higher with ground truth objects.

#### c. Precision:
Precision in object detection is a metric that assesses the accuracy of a model's detections. It measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive detections to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. In the context of object detection, a "positive detection" refers to a bounding box or region proposed by the model that correctly corresponds to an actual object in the scene.

#### d. Recall:
Recall, in the context of object detection, is another important metric that evaluates the completeness of a model's detections. It measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive detections to the total number of actual positive objects present in the scene.

## Usage
- Upload industrial video data for analysis.
- The system will analyze the video in real-time, detecting potential hazards.
- The dashboard provides real-time statistics on safety incidents.
- When a hazard is detected, the system triggers alerts and interventions as needed.
